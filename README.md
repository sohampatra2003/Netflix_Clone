# Netflix Clone

This is the clone of a popular video streaming website [Netflix](https://netflix.com/browse).

We are gonna use the proper color scheme using css variables and official images.

Colors:

1. rgb(20, 20, 20) - background color
2. #fff - text color

Typography:
Netflix uses the font "Netflix Sans" which is not available to the public, so we're gonna use a similar font, [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans)
